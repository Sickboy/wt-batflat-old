Batflat
=======

Batflat was created as a lightweight alternative to heavy and outdated CMS'. Many people use complex solutions for simple pages, unnecessarily. Building this content management system, we focused on simplicity - even novice webmaster adapt his template and writes his own module. To achieve this, we implemented a simple template system and trivial application architecture.

Batflat does not require MySQL database, because all the data are collected in a single file. This provides perfect portability when changing your hosting provider. Just copy all the files from one account to another. That's all. There's nothing to configure or to change. However, if you SQLite does not meet your requirements, you can quickly change the database type thanks to PDO.

What's more, Batflat does not have installation wizard, because there is no such need. Right after uploading a package to an FTP server, Batflat is ready for action! Therefore, the installation process takes as much time as it takes to transfer files ;-)

Each page can have it's own individual name and URL, that makes Batflat SEO friendly. Your site may be available in multiple languages. Currently Bootflat supports translation to Polish, English, French, Turkish, Swedish, Italian and Russian.

Control panel and the default template is fully responsive, which makes it accessible from any mobile device, even on the phone thanks to used CSS framework - Bootstrap. Each of our module is adapted to it.
